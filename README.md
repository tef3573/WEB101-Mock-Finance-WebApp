## 📚 About CodePath  
CodePath is a nonprofit that offers industry-supported courses to college students.  
WEB101 focuses on hands-on experience with front-end development, preparing students to build real, deployable websites and projects.

## About This Course  
This project was created for **WEB101: Intro to Web Development**, an **extracurricular course** I chose to take through **CodePath** during the semester. WEB101 teaches the foundations of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and the capstone project is to build a **fully functional, single-page Event Website**. Throughout the course, each unit focuses on a new component of the final site — layout, styling, interactivity, responsive design, and structure — and by the end of the course, every student produces a complete website they can share publicly.

## 🎯 Why I Took This Course  
I enrolled in CodePath’s WEB101 because I wanted to learn how to:
- Build **interactive**, **responsive**, and **embeddable** front-end components  
- Understand **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** well enough to create custom widgets  
- Design elements that can be used in places like **Notion dashboards**, personal websites, and portfolio pages  
- Expand my technical skillset beyond backend/data work into UI experiences I can integrate with analytics tools and finance workflows  

This class gave me the foundation to create **clean, modular, reusable web components**, which is essential for the type of financial and analytical tools I want to build.

## 🖥️ About My Event Website

### 🔎 This site includes:
- A styled **event header**
- A description of the live session  
- A **responsive layout** using Flexbox  
- A custom **JavaScript countdown timer**

The theme reflects my interests in **quantitative finance, market analysis, and web-based analytical tools**.
